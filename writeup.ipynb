    "### Step 3. Pre-Process the Data Set ###\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we can do many things such as normalizing the input so that the data has mean zero and equal variance. For image data we can normalize easily using (pixel - 128)/128.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are other processing steps which can be optional. As we progress following are the options that we can explore.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Grayscaling\n",
    "2. Data Normalization or Standardization\n",
    "3. Exploring various contract and brightness aspects\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Image Normalization ####\n",
    "Normalization, feature scaling, or standardization is the last step in preprocessing our dataset, An implementation of MINMAX which applies (pixel - 128)/ 128 to every pixel of the image Mean normalization applying (pixel - images_mean) / images_std to every pixel of the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### CALHE Histogram Equalization ###\n",
    "The histogram equalization which we have used considers the global contrast of the image. In many cases, it is not a good idea. For example, in some of the images(see below) shows an input image and its result after global histogram equalization. The adaptive histogram equalization is used. In this, image is divided into small blocks called \"tiles\" (tileSize is 8x8 by default in OpenCV). Then each of these blocks are histogram equalized as usual. So in a small area, histogram would confine to a small region (unless there is noise). If noise is there, it will be amplified. To avoid this, contrast limiting is applied. If any histogram bin is above the specified contrast limit (by default 40 in OpenCV), those pixels are clipped and distributed uniformly to other bins before applying histogram equalization. After equalization, to remove artifacts in tile borders, bilinear interpolation is applied.\n",

    "The main idea of the Inception architecture is to consider how an optimal local sparse structure of a convolutional vision\n",
    "network can be approximated and covered by readily available dense components. As these “Inception modules” are stacked on top of each other, their output correlation statistics are bound to vary: as features of higher abstraction are captured by higher layers, their spatial concentration is expected to decrease. This suggests that the ratio of 3×3 and 5×5 convolutions should increase as we move to higher layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "All the convolutions, including those inside the Inception modules, use rectified linear activation. The size of the receptive field in our network is 32x32 in the RGB color space with zero mean. “#3×3 reduce” and “#5×5 reduce” stands for the number of 1×1 filters in the reduction layer used before the 3×3 and 5×5 convolutions. One can see the number of 1×1 filters in the projection layer after the built-in max-pooling in the pool proj column. All these reduction/projection layers use rectified linear activation as well.\n",

    "\n",
    "The CNN architecture was inspired by [GoogLeNet] (https://www.cs.unc.edu/~wliu/papers/GoogLeNet.pdf). Color image with 32x32 px resolution is used as input, 43 neourns in the output layer represent the all signs present the signames.csv file. The CNN consists of two inception modules which are the same to ones from the GoogLeNet, but with two dimension reduction / dimension increase convolution 1x1 layers before and after 3x3 and 5x5 convolutions inception modules are alternating with maxpooling layers and are followed by a fc layer with 1024 output neurons. The layer uses 50% dropout and experiments shown that it really help to decrease overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "The architecture is combination of CNN and GoogLeNet and created with lot of trial and error to decrease the overfitting by using 50% dropouts and underfitting by just selecting enough EPOCHS.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* What were some problems with the initial architecture?\n",
    "\n",
    "There were several problems starting from the EPOCHs if increased would take enoromous CPU time, Increasing the Inception Model between 1x1, 3x3, and 5x5 needs to be balanced to achieve proper distribution. Since the images were not distributed evenly (may be I can use shuffle) there was poor training accuracy results early on.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* How was the architecture adjusted and why was it adjusted? Typical adjustments could include choosing a different model architecture, adding or taking away layers (pooling, dropout, convolution, etc), using an activation function or changing the activation function. One common justification for adjusting an architecture would be due to overfitting or underfitting. A high accuracy on the training set but low accuracy on the validation set indicates over fitting; a low accuracy on both sets indicates under fitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was a trial and error process, but most of the steps were either inspired by the GoogleLeNet paper or some of them after discussing or even looking at the different hyper parameters from the github.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since it was image classification problem, convnet layers were used with inception models to reduce the computation.It seems to me that inception moduls are essential for good performance on such kind of tasks as they allow to do not select optimal layer (say, convolution 5x5 or 3x3), by performing on multiple layers it selects the optimal inception Model on its own.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even the drop out was not considered early on but after toiling through some of the code I introduced dropout which avoided the overfitting of the data, increased accuracy on the testing set in the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Which parameters were tuned? How were they adjusted and why?\n",
    "\n",
    "There were several parameter were toggled strides in the Convulation layers, Sized of the convultion layers inside the Inception Model, 1x1, 3x3 and 5x5.  \n",
    "\n",
    "dropout rate toggled between 30-60, 43 seems to be optimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hyper Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "* EPOCHS = 35\n",
    "* LEARNING RATe = 4e-4 \n",
    "* BATCH_SIZE = 128 \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* What are some of the important design choices and why were they chosen? For example, why might a convolution layer work well with this problem? How might a dropout layer help with creating a successful model?\n",
    "\n",
    "There were several design chocies during the run, right from selecting the optimal LeNet architecture in this case I referred to the [GoogLeNet] (https://www.cs.unc.edu/~wliu/papers/GoogLeNet.pdf), which prescribed coming out with Inception Model which included 1x1, 3x3 and 5x5 convnet models. \n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of performance CNN will outperform traditional Neural Networks, another main feature of CNNs is weight sharing. Lets take an example to explain this. Say you have a one layered CNN with 10 filters of size 5x5. Now you can simply calculate parameters of such a CNN, it would be 5*5*10 weights and 10 biases i.e 5* 5*10 + 10 = 260 parameters.\n",
    "\n",
